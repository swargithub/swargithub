# DevOps Shell Scripting

**Reduce manual activity.**

Linux VM

`list the details of a directory`. —>. `ls -ltr`
`man` command —> `man ls`

ls —> listing files or folders
touch to create file
man to show manual for any command

*Shebang*  `#!/bin/bash`
This tells the kernel what is going to execute this shell script. 
Ex: bash, sh, dash, ksh, zsh


first-shell-script.sh
	#!/bin/bash

	echo “My name is Swaroop”


To Execute this file : ./first-shell-script.sh
We can also use : sh first-shell-script.sh

To change permissions: use the command chmod
> chmod Owner/Group/User permissions
> man chmod
> chmod 777 first-shell-script.sh
7 -> 4 ( Read) 2 ( Write) 1 ( Execute )
444 -> Read Read Read



sample-shell-script.sh
	#!/bin/bash
	
	# create a folder
	mkdir swaroop
	# Create Files
	touch firstfile secondfile


> chmod 777 sample-shell-script.sh

> chmod 111 sample-shell-script.sh

To delete a foder >rm -rf foldername
